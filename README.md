Welcome! This portfolio is a collection of my journey as a researcher, writer, and designer.
It brings together my passion for ideas, stories, and creativity, all in one place.

 About This Portfolio

This website is a living notebook of my work.
Here you’ll find:

Research → Papers, case studies, and deep dives into topics that inspire curiosity.

 Writing → Articles, essays, and projects that show my love for words and storytelling.

 Design → Creative work where ideas meet visuals — from web layouts to graphics.

I’ve built this space to connect, share, and keep adding as I grow.
